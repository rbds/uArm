# uArm

3 DOF parallel-link robotic arm. 

The CAD files for this project can be found on Thingiverse here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480446. I (mostly) followed the directions there for the hardware. 

The microcontroller is an Arduino Uno, with a Pololu servo controller to control the joints. The project uses a joystick and RF serial link to control the arm remotely. 

This is a work in progress, so pictures, directions, and code are still being updated.
